This program is a series of programs using web programming languages. Some of them are learnt (not inherit any codes from elsewhere, just learn how each part is working and write independent programming coding work in my own program) from online tutorials, developed licensed projects and courses.
* If a folder includes a license, it means it is an imported repository (not my work, just used for learning).
* If a folder does not contain a license, it is my own developed work (Ideas may from other places).
* To see all works' explanations and  **Documentation** folder (https://github.com/daijingz/Web-Programming-Applications/tree/main/Documentation)
* To see all early applications about Node.js and React.js please visit these 2 directories:
1. https://github.com/daijingz/Web-Programming-Applications/tree/main/Node.js
2. https://github.com/daijingz/Web-Programming-Applications/tree/main/React.js


**USED techniques, programming languages and tools**
* Regular web programming tools: **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
* **React.js and Node.js** advanced libraries (Have learnt a lot and works are coming)
